.SH NETWORKING OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-autojoin\fR
Automatically search the local LAN for a multiplayer server and join it.

\fB\-extratics <n>\fR
Send n extra tics in every packet as insurance against dropped packets. 
.TP
\fB\-ignoreversion\fR
When running a netgame server, ignore version mismatches between the server and the client. Using this option may cause game desyncs to occur, or differences in protocol may mean the netgame will simply not function at all. 
.TP
\fB\-newsync\fR
Use new network client sync code rather than the classic sync code. This is currently disabled by default because it has some bugs. 
.TP
\fB\-nodes <n>\fR

.SH DEHACKED AND WAD MERGING
.TP
\fB\-aa <files>\fR

Simulates the behavior of NWT's \-af option, merging flats into the main IWAD directory.  Multiple files may be specified. 
.TP
\fB\-as <files>\fR
Simulates the behavior of NWT's \-as option, merging sprites into the main IWAD directory.  Multiple files may be specified. 
.TP
\fB\-deh <files>\fR
Load the given dehacked patch(es) 
.TP
\fB\-merge <files>\fR
Simulates the behavior of deutex's \-merge option, merging a PWAD into the main IWAD.  Multiple files may be specified. 
.TP
\fB\-nocheats\fR
Ignore cheats in dehacked files. 
.TP
\fB\-nwtmerge <files>\fR
Simulates the behavior of NWT's \-merge option.  Multiple files may be specified.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
This section describes environment variables that control Chocolate Hexen's
behavior.
.TP
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR, \fBDOOMWADPATH\fR
These environment variables provide paths to search for Doom .WAD files when
looking for a game IWAD file or a PWAD file specified with the `\-file' option.
\fBDOOMWADDIR\fR specifies a single path in which to look for WAD files,
while \fBDOOMWWADPATH\fR specifies a colon-separated list of paths to search.
.TP
\fBPCSOUND_DRIVER\fR
When running in PC speaker sound effect mode, this environment variable
specifies a PC speaker driver to use for sound effect playback.  Valid
options are "Linux" for the Linux console mode driver, "BSD" for the
NetBSD/OpenBSD PC speaker driver, and "SDL" for SDL-based emulated PC speaker
playback (using the digital output).
.TP
\fBOPL_DRIVER\fR
When using OPL MIDI playback, this environment variable specifies an
OPL backend driver to use.  Valid options are "SDL" for an SDL-based
software emulated OPL chip, "Linux" for the Linux hardware OPL driver,
and "OpenBSD" for the OpenBSD/NetBSD hardware OPL driver.

Generally speaking, a real hardware OPL chip sounds better than software
emulation; however, modern machines do not often include one. If
present, it may still require extra work to set up and elevated
security privileges to access.
