
If bullet flashes of guns on brutal doom, its something to do with the gzdoom.pk3 file. Pre built version seemed to work (Had the old version in there actually)

Strange white lines on GZdoom brutal doom doom2 first level, have to:
gl_interface.cpp
glDisable(GL_CLIP_PLANE0);
glEnable(GL_CLIP_PLANE0);
